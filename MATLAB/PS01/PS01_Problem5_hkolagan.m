%% INITIALIZATION ---
A =[2 5 8 5; 10 9 1 4; 6 3 2 10]

%% CALCULATIONS ---
m = A(2,3);    % Assigns value of specified location in matrix A
%s = A(5,4);   % There is no row 5 that exists
B = A(1,:);    % Assigns values in the first row of array A
C = A(2,:);    % Assigns values in the second row of array A
D = A(:,3);    % Assigns value of the third number in each row
E = sort(D);   % Sorts the values in the Column D from least to greatest
A(2,4) = 40;   % Assigns value of 40 to the specified location in array A
F = A(1:2);    % Assigns values of the first number in the first 2 rows of array A
G = A(2:3);    % Assigns values of the first number in the second 2 rows of array A
H = A(1:2,2:3);% Assigns values of the first 2 number in the first 2 rows of array A
J = [C B];     % Assigns values of C and B in one row
K = [C;B];     % Assigns values of C and B in seperate rows
%L = [D C];    % Dimensions of each variable are different

M = A(3,:)
N = A(2,3)
A(1,2) = 55
